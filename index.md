### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was my favorite because I made patterns with loops which I found pretty satisfying seeing the end result. I used a for loop to create it and it was not overly complicated. Overall this lab showed me the possibilities of making patterns with C++ and we can create art with text.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was my favorite because we were able to make a spell checker that can be useful for personal use. This program scanned a document file for misspelled words and used a dictionary file to find which words were spelled wrong or correct. Overall this lab showed me how much we innovated and created things like a spell checker to help us correct errors. 

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 3 was my favorite because we were able to create our first ever image through C++. The picture was composed of three different colors, red, green, and blue. We combined these colors and created a gradient through loops and file formats. Overall this lab showed me we can produce images by just coding and it made me wonder what more we can make.
